# wikiDemoCode

Basic workflow for building the git repo:
1. Unity project for testing the code
2. 


test code snippet
```csharp
void Movement3D(vector3 direction, float movementSpeed)
{
        rigidBody.velocity = new Vector3(direction.x * movementSpeed, rigidBody.velocity.y, direction.y * movementSpeed);

}
```
